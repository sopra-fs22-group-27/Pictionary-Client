## Introduction: 
We decided together that we would implement the drawing and guessing game Pictionary. The rules of this game are amazingly simple. A game consists of custom number of rounds where someone must draw an offered word and the others must guess it. If someone guesses the word correctly, the player gets one point. The player with the most points at the end wins the game.

## High-level components

[Game](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-27/Pictionary-Client/blob/master/src/components/views/Game.js)
This is the most crucial component, as it is here that the game takes place. This component is used by both the drawers and the guessers to show the game interface. When the game begins, players are sent to this component from the component WaitingScreen. Depending on the role of the player different tools are shown (eg. palette for drawers, canvas, the drawing word and more) or (eg. canvas for guessers, and the input box).

After logging in, the Player can interact with the program using this component. They can view all of the Lobbies and join them (which will take them to the WaitingScreen), or they can make their own game (which will take them to Create-Game), or they can go to the scoreboard and look at the scores or their profile.

[Scoreboard](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-27/Pictionary-Client/blob/master/src/components/views/ScoreBoard.js)
On the scoreboard, logged in users are able to view their and others overall scores. From the scoreboard users are able to look at their profile and change their information. 


## Launch & Deployment

For your local development environment you'll need Node.js >= 8.10. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies including React get installed with:

```
// Install all necessary modules (first time running app)
npm install
```

This has to be done before starting the application for the first time (only once).

```
// Start
npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome!).

## Roadmap

- Add a different game mode  where the users can play some kind of drinking game.
- Create shapes which could be used by drag & drop during drawing.
- Make the application more secure.
